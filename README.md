InfluxDB
========

An Ansible role to install, configure, and manage [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb) (a time-series database).

Requirements
------------

Prior knowledge/experience with InfluxDB is highly recommended. Full documentation is available [here](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/introduction/overview.html).

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

No other dependencies are required.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
